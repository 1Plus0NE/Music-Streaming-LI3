# Laborat√≥rios de Inform√°tica III (2024/2025)

## Grade: 17/20 ‚≠ê

This project consists of developing a modular and memory-efficient music streaming system in C, capable of processing user, artist, album, and playback data to answer complex queries. Our project includes three execution modes (batch, interactive, and testing) and emphasizes data validation, encapsulation, and performance analysis. 

[GLib](https://docs.gtk.org/glib/)'s [HashTable](https://docs.gtk.org/glib/struct.HashTable.html) were used as the primary data structures to optimize parsing, query execution and memory usage.

Project requirements (set by professors) can be viewed in `requirements.pdf` (üáµüáπ)

## Building

### Dependencies

- GNU Make (build-time)
- GCC (build-time)
- GLib (run-time)

### Building

A release build is achieved with:

``` console
$ cd trabalho-pratico
$ make
```

To remove files generated by a build, run:

``` console
$ make clean
```

To run the project in batch mode, run:

``` console
$ ./programa-principal <dataset-path> <inputs-path>
```

To run the project in interactive mode, run:

``` console
$ ./programa-interativo <dataset-path> <inputs-path>
```

To run the project in test mode, run:

``` console
$ ./programa-testes <dataset-path> <inputs-path> <outputs-path>
```

## Queries

Regarding queries 4, 5 and 6, these were implemented, but their outputs did not fully match the expected results during testing. Additionally, queries 4 and 6 demonstrated performance issues when executed on large datasets, resulting in noticeably slower response times.
Nevertheless, our group decided to keep them in the repository for future analysis or potential debugging and improvement.
